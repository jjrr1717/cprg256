            <h3>Creating the Base (Cont'd)</h3>
            <ul>
                <ol start = "3">
                    <li>Align the two assembled Lego blocks close together so that the 2x4 pin light blue Lego piece is 
                        touching the 2x3 pin red Lego piece.  The block with the red Lego piece will be horizontally aligned, 
                        while the block with the blue Lego piece will be vertically aligned. The assembled blocks will be right aligned 
                        with each other.</li>
                    <li>Connect one of the 1x4 pin blue Lego pieces on top of the 2x4 pin light blue Lego piece. The 1x4 
                        pin blue Lego will take up 3 pins of the light blue Lego and it is right aligned.</li>
                    <li>Connect the 1x4 pin blue Lego piece, that you used in step 4, on top of the yellow and red Lego
                        blocks that were assembled in step 1.  It will be bottom and right aligned on the red piece.</li>
                    <li>Connect the 1x4 pin blue Lego piece, that you used in step 4, on top of the yellow and red Lego 
                        blocks that were assembled in step 1.  It will be bottom and right aligned on the red piece.</li>
                    <li>Connect the 1x4 pin white Lego piece in a similar manner as described in step 5, however, place it 
                        directly left of the 1x4 pin blue Lego piece that was used in step 5.</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>

            <h3>Creating the Top Line of the &quot;J&quot;</h3>
            <ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Connect one of the 1x4 pin blue Lego pieces horizontally across the top of the Lego block that
                        was created in step one.  This Lego piece will be top and left aligned and will take up 3 pins of
                        the 2x3 pin red Lego piece.</li>
                    <li>Connect one of the 1x4 pin blue Lego pieces horizontally across the top of the Lego block that 
                        was created in step 1. This Lego piece will be top and right aligned with Lego black assembled 
                        in step 1. It will take up 1 pin of the 2x3 pin red Lego piece.</li>
                    <li>Connect the 1x4 pin &frac12; depth green Lego piece to the bottom of the 1x4 pin blue Lego piece that
                        was attached in step 2. The 1x4 pin &frac12; depth green Lego will have one pin showing to the right 
                        side.</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>	    	   
            
            <h3>Creating the Bottom Line of the &quot;J&quot;</h3>
            <ul>
                <ol>
                    <li>Connect the 1x3 pin yellow Lego piece horizontally on the bottom of the 2x4 pin light blue Lego 
                        piece.  This Lego piece will be bottom and right aligned. There will be one of the yellow pins 
                        extending out to the left.</li>
                    <li>Connect the 1x4 pin yellow Lego piece to the bottom of the extended 1x3 pin yellow Lego piece 
                        that was assembled in step 1. This Lego piece is right aligned.</li>
                    <li>Connect the 1x3 pin blue Lego piece on top of the 1x4 pin yellow Lego piece that you assembled 
                        in step 2.  They should be perfectly aligned.</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
